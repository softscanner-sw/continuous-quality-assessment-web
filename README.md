# SoftScanner Backend ‚Äì Continuous Quality Assessment Platform
SoftScanner is an **automated continuous quality assessment (CQA) platform** designed for **web applications**. This backend service provides **instrumentation, telemetry collection and storage, metric computation, and continuous goal assessments** using the **SoftScanner Quality Mapping Model (SSQMM)**, aligned with **ISO/IEC 25010 (2023) standards**.

SoftScanner maps high-level quality goals to observable metrics through **SSQMM**. Each goal assessment is **timestamped**, enabling **historical tracking of quality trends** and **long-term storage for analysis**.

Instrumentation bundles are dynamically generated and deployed to target applications, ensuring non-invasive instrumentation. The design is **modular and extensible**, making it easy to integrate with different telemetry providers such as **OpenTelemetry** for trace data and **Prometheus** for system metrics.

## üîß Setup & Installation
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (>= 16.x recommended)
- **npm** (bundled with Node.js)
- **MongoDB** (>= 6.x)
- **TypeScript Compiler**
- **Webpack** (for generating instrumentation bundles)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/softscanner-sw/softscanner-backend.git
cd softscanner-backend
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Running MongoDB
Create a database named `continuous-quality-assessment-web-telemetry-mongodb` at `localhost:27017`.  
You can use [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) for easy management.

Start MongoDB:
```bash
mongo "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
use "continuous-quality-assessment-web-telemetry-mongodb"
```

Telemetry and assessments are stored in MongoDB or on filesystems. Each instrumentation bundle has associated telemetry data and assessments. This change enables:

- **Long-term storage of quality assessments**
- **Easy retrieval for comparative analysis**
- **Improved monitoring and tracking of quality trends**

#### MongoDB Database Schema
```json
{
  "normalizedAppName": "posts-users-ui-ng",
  "bundles": [
    {
      "name": "posts-users-ui-ng_2025_02_13T13_05_30_915Z.bundle.js",
      "telemetryData": [...],
      "assessments": [
        {
          "goal": "User Engagement",
          "globalScore": 85,
          "timestamp": "2025-02-13T13:05:30Z",
          "details": [
            {
              "metric": "NUU",
              "value": 10,
              "weight": 0.4,
              "timestamp": "2025-02-13T13:05:30Z"
            },
            {
              "metric": "UIF",
              "value": 15,
              "weight": 0.6,
              "timestamp": "2025-02-13T13:05:30Z"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Backend
```bash
npm start
```
This will:
1. **Compile TypeScript files**.
2. **Launch the backend server** (`http://localhost:3000`).
3. **Expose REST API endpoints** for quality assessment.
4. **Enable telemetry collection, storage, and live goal assessment**.

## üì° API Overview
SoftScanner Backend provides structured **RESTful APIs** to interact with **quality models, goals, metrics, and assessments**.

### üîó Key Endpoints
| Method   | Endpoint                            | Description                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **GET**  | `/api/quality-model`                | Retrieves the quality model and associated goals. |
| **POST** | `/api/assessment`                   | Initiates a new quality assessment.               |
| **GET**  | `/api/progress?assessmentId=XYZ`    | Streams live progress updates via SSE.            |
| **GET**  | `/api/assessments?assessmentId=XYZ` | Streams live assessment results continously.             |

---

## üìú Quality Assessment Workflow
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define Quality Goals and Provide Metadata
Users select relevant **quality goals** and provide application metadata.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Automatic Instrumentation
SoftScanner dynamically generates and injects **telemetry agents** for runtime data collection.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection, Storage & Metric Computation
The instrumented application continuously collects and stores **real-time data**, and **SoftScanner computes quality metrics**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Timestamped Goal Assessments
- Each goal stores multiple **timestamped assessments** with metric contributions and global scores.  
- Historical tracking enables **trend analysis** and **comparative assessments**.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Continous Real-Time API Updates
Users can:
- **Monitor progress** (`/api/progress`).
- **Retrieve assessment history** (`/api/assessments`).
